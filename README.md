# KKC v1.2
KISS Keychain Configurator

I always wanted to have an easy way to configure my KISS setups.
I am the originator of the KISS WiFi, KISS mobile apps, even OpenTx LUA scripts for adjustments. They all are working fine. But ... I needed something else.

Something less and something more at the same time, some device that can change all config parameters, help me diagnose problems, configure ESCs and even charge my cameras when they run out of juice. A device that does not require a wireless connection, drivers or setup activation. So I made the KISS Keychain Configurator aka KKC. A simple addition to the KISS family - enjoy!

Btw: the KKC is my own breed and NOT an official Flyduino product and you can purchase it at various shops soon.

KISS KEYCHAIN CONFIGURATOR now available in my shop at https://shop.anuta.org/
